# nlp-project
A bundle of programs for generating Big Time Rush-like sentences in Python using a context-free grammar generated in Java.

## Setup
For Python, we recommend setting up a virtual environment
1. Create the environment
```
python -m venv nlp-env
```
2. Activate it


On Windows this would be done by running
```
nlp-env/Scripts/activate
```
3. Install requirements
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
