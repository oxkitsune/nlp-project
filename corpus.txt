Most of us, at some point in our lives,

have abandoned a project half way through.

But most of us don't have that abandoned project

sitting on full, permanent display to the world.

This is the Road to Nowhere, 
in Yate, in south-west England.

Let's go for a walk.

This is 400m of never-completed 1970s highway

that goes from a roundabout to...

well, nowhere, it's cut off by a railway line.

I'm actually a little bit amazed that 
I only just found out about this,

because "half-completed road to nowhere",

with lane markings and kerbs and everything,

is very much the sort of thing that I'd expect 
younger me to have filmed five years ago.

And this place is not a secret. 
This is a big public common.

There's folks walking their dogs here.

The public can't drive on this 
road, though: it's gated off.

If you look at aerial photos,
you  can see where it was meant to go.

There's another roundabout a little way 
over there that it would have connected to,

completing a small ring road around the town.

And you can see exactly what the 
plan was... it just never happened.

And yes, there are a lot of complaints 
about the traffic in this town.

Also on those aerial photos:

some heavy equipment, and a fake bridge
being built just down there.

See, this road does have a use.

The local council makes it available for filming,

the whole area is closed occasionally 
for television shows to shoot on.

And they can make it look like 
either a small country road

or a big highway depending on 
where they point their camera.

Broadchurch used careful 
angles and one composite shot

to make it look like a coast road.

And hospital drama Casualty have 
shot quite a few things here

over the 36 years they've been in production.

That includes their most expensive scenes ever,

which involved a huge fake bridge,
crashing vehicles,

adding a CGI town around the road,

and setting off an enormous tanker explosion.

For all it cost, it's actually 
a little bit underwhelming?

Maybe that's a creative decision, 
maybe it looks more realistic that way.

And it's convincing enough.

This is an accidental film set.

At some point, some British studio would 
probably have built one of these anyway,

it just wouldn't look as good.

So the question is: why did this happen?

I don't actually know. I gave up on 
researching this project half way through.

Okay, no, I'm just kidding, according 
to one former local councillor,

it's because the price of steel suddenly went up,

the council didn't want to pay that much
for the railway bridge over there,

so they put the whole thing on hold,

and no-one ever started the 
project up again afterwards.

There are still occasional vague 
political calls to complete it,

but I would be very surprised 
if there's any traffic

other than stunt drivers and dog walkers

on the Road to Nowhere any time soon.

Welcome to Foulness Island.

The name is unfortunate.

It either meant 'muddy headland'

or possibly 'bird headland'
a few centuries ago.

It's about nine square miles,

there's around 150 people who live on it.

But unless you are one of those people
or you've got business with them,

you will not be allowed in.

Most of the island and, importantly,

the road and bridge that get you onto it:

they're owned by the British military
and they will turn you away.

But despite having no business here,

I am on the island, legally.

And that's because I didn't
use the road and bridge.

I walked along a very
different path to get here.

The Broomway has been called

the most dangerous, most
deadly path in Britain.

It goes back at least 600 years.

And the only reason that
I walked here safely

is because I had a guide.

A few miles back before we set off,
I asked him a few questions.

- Historically, there is reportedly
60-100 casualties on the Broomway.

The main thing is the tide.
It whips round from the North Sea

and would come from, not as you expect,
straight on from the horizon,

but it'll often spiral in to the coastline,
and so it'll cut you off from your pathway.

It's very easy to get
lost out on the Broomway,

particularly in low-visibility
conditions when it's raining

or there's low fog,
early morning, late at night.

As there's no features or markers
to take your bearing from,

you can get very quickly disorientated.

Quite often, people will
naturally walk further out to sea,

as opposed to back to land.

The Broomway's only open at
the weekends for the public.

The MOD use this as an
active firing range,

and they have done since the late 1800s.

And so, one thing that we might
see out there is leftover ordnance.

They do a pretty good job of
cleaning up after themselves,

but it doesn't mean that
we won't see any out there.

I've seen shells this big.

You just have to really
keep your distance.

Shell craters are also a problem

because of the exploded ordnance
that has gone off,

so it's essentially quick sand.

And so, there'll be pockets of sand
which are really soft and mushy

that your feet will sink into
that we have to be careful of.

I only guide walks when the
tide is constantly going out.

So, we are three hours after high tide.

The tide is still on its way out,

and we should be coming back
here as the tides are turning.

- So, obviously, we made it.
Thank you, Tom!

The path's called the Broomway

because back before the
military built that bridge,

back when it was the only
access onto this island,

it was marked by "brooms"
every 30 metres or so.

Now, to 21st-century people,

that implies broom handles
sticking out the ground.

But, no, I tracked down a photo from 1922,

and the brooms were just
short lumps of brush.

But over the last century,
those brooms stopped being maintained.

They were either swept away or eroded,

and now the path is unmarked.
But it's still on the map.

It's still a legal path.

Permanently closing a right-of-way
in Britain is difficult.

- On Foulness, there are public right-of-way
footpaths that we can access.

They are rarely used.
And so, if you do take them,

the security switchboards will light up

because you'll get reported by MOD staff
or by locals who live there

because they think you're trespassing.

I wouldn't be guiding this if I wasn't
a qualified mountain leader

who has map and compass skills,

good experience of this
guided walk that I do.

I have first aid qualifications,
so I know how to deal with

and treat the likely emergencies
that could happen out here.

- That article from 1922

also named some of the
people who died on the path.

Several doctors travelling
to attend patients,

young women trying to reach partners,
and island residents who got careless,

or who would sometimes stay
in the mainland pubs too late

and then try to race the tide
back on a galloping horse.

Because the part of the Broomway we walked
isn't just a footpath.

Under modern law, it is a
"byway open to all traffic",

which means that, in theory,
you can take a horse

or a tractor or anything
that's road legal onto it.

It would be a very, very bad idea
to just drive onto the sands,

but in theory you could,
if you didn't get bogged down.

Now, a few times a year,
the village on the island

and the main road are open for tourism,

but not right now, not in 2020,

which means that right
now there is only one way

for the average person to
get onto Foulness Island.

But there are two ways to leave.

We could go off the rights of way,
trespass onto military land,

and then very soon after get
escorted off by soldiers,

assuming we weren't arrested.

Or... we can just walk back.

Ready when you are!
- Let's go!

- Thank you very much to Tom Bennett!

He's a qualified mountain leader
who runs tours across Britain.

I'll put a link to his website
in the description.

It feels really weird talking about you

in the third person
when you're just there.

[both laughing]
- Yeah.

[water sloshing]

- Ugh!

All right, is that focused?

Think so, hope so.

Good, I haven't got long.

It is the end of the day,
I'm losing the light.

I've got to drive on and
then catch a flight soon.

So I'm going to tell you a story,

but I have not been able to
work out how much of it is true.

And that's okay,
and I'll tell you why that's okay,

but it does put me in a
bit of a difficult position

because everyone that I've met here

in Wichita Falls, Texas, has been lovely.

And this is a great story
that sends tourists to their town.

So, with that said, this is
the Newby-McMahon Building,

the World's Littlest Skyscraper.

It's not much of a skyscraper,
it's only four stories tall,

and its footprint is so small
that it is barely usable as a building.

Now the legend goes that
back when Wichita Falls

was an oil boom town, 1918,

there was a massive construction rush.

Investors were pouring money
into new downtown buildings,

confident that the town
would be prime real estate

for decades to come.

Unfortunately, it wasn't.

The boom was followed by a bust
and by the Great Depression.

But this building caused its investors
more trouble than most.

It cost $200,000, which is
about $3 million in today's money

and the investors thought
that it was going to be 12 times as tall

because the blueprints
they thought were marked in feet

were actually in inches.

No one noticed the little extra mark
next to the numbers on the plans.

So the new downtown skyscraper turned out
to be only four stories tall and not 48,

and so narrow it was almost unusable.

The developer, J.D. McMahon,
ran off with most of the money,

all that was left over from only
having to construct a tiny building,

and a local judge ruled that
the blueprints were accurate.

The investors had got exactly
what they'd signed off on,

exactly what they paid for.

The building sat abandoned for a long time

and it was renovated in
the early 21st century

and these days, it's a furniture boutique

and I talked to the owner.

- When we first took over this building
with our shop,

this skyscraper was never
allowed to be entered by the public

and we wanted to open it up.

The engineers had to come

to make sure the floors could
sustain constant occupancy

and in fact, they did have to give us
some weight and load limits

and they did have to put in
an additional structural beam.

Whenever you have a multi-story building,

by City code, there must
be an egress and entrance.

So, they had said, well, we must have
at least two staircases to allow for that.

Well, if this building
had two sets of stairs,

it would literally be a building
full of two sets of stairs

and there would be no
defined space whatsoever.

So, I think, as the
compromise from our City,

we do have a state-of-the-art
fire suppression system.

The fire marshal that comes
to inspect it periodically

tells me that if we do ever catch on fire,

we will not have to worry about burning,

but we might have to worry about drowning.

In the early '30s, this
was engulfed in flames

and so the floors were gone,
the roof was gone

and it got boarded up and
it stood that way for decades.

We do have some old newspaper accounts

and some old documentation of
people that were interviewed back then,

how they wanted the building
to be demolished immediately

because it was a scandal.

You know, these people had been ripped off

and they were embarrassed
about being duped like this.

However, it wasn't demolished because
they really needed it for office space

so it was used.

So we do have some
documentation like that,

but the original plans
that allegedly he had given

to his investors, they don't exist,
as far as I know.

- It's a great story.

So I started to fact-check it
and I came up blank.

Here's what I did before getting here.

I tracked down every article
I could on every database I could access,

but they were all too modern
and the chain of references ran out,

usually somewhere in the '80s.

There are references to a "Ripley's
Believe It or Not" panel from the 1920s,

but I emailed the archivists
at Ripley's and they said

their archives are incomplete.
They don't have a copy of it.

No one has a copy of it.

And look, if we're honest,
"Ripley's Believe It or Not"

is not a reliable primary source.

So, when I got here, I went
to the Wichita Falls Library over there,

thank you so much to all
the librarians who helped,

and I looked through the
local newspaper from 1919.

It's not been digitised so I had to hunt through microfilm and scan headlines

and in the time I had here,

I couldn't find a mention of the building
or of the lawsuit at all.

I did find an article
about the changing skyline.

It has no mention of a
planned 48-story building.

So, it feels like the real estate scandal,
the lawsuit after,

should have been all over the news
when it came out, surely,

but maybe I missed it.
Maybe it was too small an article.

In boom times it might have been,

or maybe I wasn't looking
at the right dates.

And look, this is a ridiculous building.

On camera, it almost looks
sensible but standing here,

it is very easy to agree
that this building,

must have been a scam of some sort.

So, if I was to place a bet,

I would say that the
scam part is likely,

that someone came along in
the middle of boom times,

sold a dodgy building
to gullible investors

and ran off with the proceeds,
is very, very plausible.

The inches instead of feet
detail of the story, though,

I just don't know.

Surely the investors would have noticed

that their giant skyscraper
only had four floors

and a couple of windows.

Surely they'd have questioned the plans,

so maybe that was a joke from
the townsfolk a century ago

that got reported as fact.

Or maybe the investors
were off in another state

and never got a close
look at the blueprints.

Or maybe it's true and they were taken in
by a smooth-talking scammer.

There is a plausible answer for
every skeptic's question about this

and I am not saying
that the story is false,

just that I can't find primary sources.

I can't find anything from the time
that is evidence for it or against it.

And if you can, don't tell me.

Write an article, post
somewhere authoritative,

take a picture of the old
newspaper and tweet it out,

update Wikipedia.

I've reached the end of what I can do.

But that's fine,
and here's why it's fine.

Because this is folklore.
This is a trickster story.

This is the same thing
that appears in mythology

from across the world and across time.

If you think you've heard
something like this before,

you have.

There are a lot of stories like it.

It's the monorail episode
of "The Simpsons."

All those news outlets and blogs repeating
and emphasizing the tale.

That's our modern oral tradition.

That's passing on stories,
person to person to person.

In a world where making up
complete lies to get ad revenue

is a viable business model,

this is kind of charming.

It's a story. And as long
as those articles say,

"according to legend",
or "the tale goes that",

then I think that's fine.

We're human, we see things
as part of a narrative.

Margaret Atwood wrote:
"in the end, we'll all become stories",

and yeah, this is a really good story.

All right, hope that worked,

'cause I've got about...
not enough time to get to Dallas.

All right, let's go.

This isn't some remote rainforest island.

I am indoors, in a waterpark.

This is the largest uninterrupted indoor space
in the world.

There are a few bigger spaces, but they've
all got support pillars holding them up.

This is just one big roof. In terms of volume,

this is bigger than NASA's Vehicle Assembly
Building.

You could fit the entire Houses of Parliament
in here. Twice.

And still have room for some more waterslides.

Along with the slides, and some cabins you
can rent overnight,

there is a tethered balloon that'll take you
up to the rafters.

Or it'll take six passengers and go for a
fly around inside.

Those panels up there: they're transparent
to UV light so the trees grow here,

which means you can get sunburn... indoors.

But in winter, this place stays at tropical
temperatures.

The amount of heating, cooling, water recirculation
required is ridiculous.

There is no way that a company could ever
afford

to build something like this, it would cost
far too much,

they would never be able to charge enough
for admission to make their money back.

And yet, here I am.

Which brings me to my main question:

what do you do with a disused airship hangar?

That's not just a theoretical question. That's
what this is.

And actually, it wasn't so much disused as
never used.

This whole structure was built on an old German
airfield,

at the turn of the millennium, during the
dotcom bubble.

It was designed to hold an enormous cargo-carrying
airship that was never built,

because the company went bankrupt a year later
as the economy crashed.

The investors lost most of their money --

it cost 78 million euro to build this thing,

it's safe to say they never got most of that
back.

A company from Malaysia bought the hangar
at a knock-down price,

a price that could, in theory, be made back
over many years

if you, say, spruced the place up and charged
admission.

Maybe added a few waterslides.

And the result is, bizarrely, the world's
largest indoor waterpark

and a fluke of our weird 21st-century economy.
