Make it count, play it straight
Don't look back, don't hesitate
When you go big time
What you want, what you feel
Never quit it, make it real
When you roll big time

Listen to your heart now
Don't you feel the rush?
Better take your shot now

Go and shake it up! What cha gotta lose?
Go and make your luck with the life you choose
If you want it all, lay it on the line
It's the only life ya got, so ya gotta live it big time

Step it up, get in gear
Go for broke, make it clear
Gotta go big time
Make it work get it right
Change the world over night
Gotta dream big time

Give it all you got now
Isn't it a rush?
Finish what you start now

Go and shake it up! What cha gotta lose?
Go and make your luck with the life you choose
If you want it all, lay it on the line
It's the only life ya got, so ya gotta live it big time
Look around
Every light is shining now it's brighter somehow
Look around
Nothings really as it seems, nothing but dreams
You and I
Gonna make a brand new sound, like we own this town
We can fly
Now our feet are off the ground, we'll never look down
Welcome to the big time
All the pretty people see you walking in the sunshine
Welcome to the good times
Life will never be the same!

Go and shake it up! What cha gotta lose?
Go and make your luck with the life you choose
If you want it all, lay it on the line
It's the only life ya got, so ya

If you want it all, lay it on the line
It's the only life ya got, so ya gotta live it big time
