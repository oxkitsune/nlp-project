make it count play it straight
do not look back do not hesitate
when you go big time

never quit it make it real
when you roll big time
listen to your heart now
do not you feel the rush
better take your shot now
go and shake it up what have you got to lose
go and make your luck with the life you choose
if you want it all lay it on the line
it is the only life ya got so ya got to live it big time
step it up get in gear
go for broke make it clear
got to go big time
make it work get it right
change the world over night
got to dream big time
give it all you got now
is not it a rush
finish what you start now
go and shake it up what have you got to lose
go and make your luck with the life you choose
if you want it all lay it on the line
it is the only life ya got so ya got to live it big time
look around
every light is shining now it is brighter somehow

welcome to the big time
all the pretty people see you walking in the sunshine
welcome to the good times

go and make your luck with the life you choose
if you want it all lay it on the line
